# Linux Command Mastery – Ani's DevOps Toolbox

Welcome to my personal command reference project.  
This repo documents essential Linux commands I actively use while working with Arch-based systems (CachyOS, Manjaro) and in virtualized environments like Ubuntu/Debian via VirtualBox.

### 📁 What You'll Find
- ✅ Real-world commands with explanations
- ✅ Use cases from my daily Linux and DevOps practice
- ✅ Written in simple, beginner-friendly language
- ✅ Markdown-based for clean formatting and clarity

### 🔧 Command Categories (so far)
- System Updates & Package Management (`pacman`)
- Directory Navigation (`cd`, `mkdir`, `ls`, `rmdir`)
- System Monitoring (`htop`)
- Administrative Access (`sudo`, `sudo -i`)
- Filesystem Awareness (`pwd`, `ls`)

### 🛠️ Tech Stack Used
- OS: CachyOS (Arch-based), Ubuntu VM
- Tools: Git, GitHub, Markdown

### 📌 Purpose
This project serves two purposes:
1. Strengthen my Linux command knowledge through structured writing.
2. Serve as proof-of-work for my DevOps/SRE journey.
